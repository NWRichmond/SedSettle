# SedSettle
SedSettle is a tool for interfacing with a digital mass balance for sediment grain size analysis via Settling Tube. SedSettle is written in MATLAB and should function on whichever operating system is compatible with the mass balance. This code was tested using an OHAUS Adventurer AX622 Mass Balance with CDM 2.08.28 WHQL Certified x86 (32-bit) drivers on Windows 10.
